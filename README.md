# 🧭 NearbyTargets (EnemyRadar)

**NearbyTargets** is a lightweight World of Warcraft 1.12 (Vanilla) addon designed to help players **see everything that can be targeted around them** — enemies, allies, pets, and healing targets — all updated in real time.  
It integrates seamlessly with **pfUI**, providing a clean, minimal, and functional interface for combat awareness and healing management.

## 💡 What It Does

NearbyTargets scans your surroundings and creates dynamic lists of nearby units — enemies, party members, and raid members — each with live health bars and color indicators.  
You can easily see:
- Which enemies are nearby and alive  
- Which party or raid members need healing  
- Which pets or summons are in range  

It’s like a **compact radar and healing assistant combined**, keeping all essential information visible without cluttering your screen.
